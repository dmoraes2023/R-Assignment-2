#Review: 
Here is the list of errors I was getting:- 
1. Error in UseMethod("select") : 
  no applicable method for 'select' applied to an object of class "character"
I think the input here is not correct.

Due to this , I could not run the further codes using "Run ALL" command. 

I found rest of your codes well written. Summary for each well explained. Graphs look good. Well done!
